//! WebSocket streams for SoDEX.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! Three are implemented, and their selectors do not share a shape:
//!
//! | Channel  | Selector | Carries |
//! |----------|----------|---------|
//! | `candle` | `symbol` + `interval` | OHLC bars, republished while forming |
//! | `trade`  | `symbols` array | Public trades with the aggressing side |
//! | `ticker` | `symbols` array | 24h statistics plus top of book, on a fixed cadence |
//!
//! The set was established by asking the venue rather than by assumption: the
//! `probe_channels` example sweeps candidate names and reports which reply `unknown channel`
//! and which reply `invalid params`, the latter meaning the name exists and only the
//! selector was wrong. That sweep also found an `accountUpdate` channel whose selector is
//! still unknown — see the crate documentation.
//!
//! # Streams carry no authorization
//!
//! The venue states that user-specific streams require no subscription authorization and
//! that any client may subscribe to another user's data. Two consequences worth stating
//! plainly:
//!
//! - Consuming account streams needs no API key, which simplifies this layer.
//! - Account activity is **not private**. Anyone holding an account id can watch that
//!   account's orders, fills and balance changes in real time. A strategy whose behaviour is
//!   inferable from its order flow — laddered entries, fixed grid spacing, predictable
//!   scale-ins — is exposed by merely trading here.
//!
//! # Liveness
//!
//! The venue drops a connection after 60 seconds without a subscription or pushed data, so
//! silence is indistinguishable from a dead link and must be probed.
//!
//! The probing itself is `nautilus-network`'s, configured with a **text** heartbeat payload:
//! this venue counts an application-level `{"op":"ping"}`, and the library's docs are
//! explicit that a text keepalive and an empty Ping control frame "are not interchangeable".
//! What remains here is the venue's own timing constraint — see [`DEFAULT_IDLE_PROBE_SECS`].
