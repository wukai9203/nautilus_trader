//! Connection lifecycle and subscription bookkeeping for the SoDEX streams.
//!
//! # The desired set is the only source of truth
//!
//! Every subscription this client has been asked for lives in one list, and every outbound
//! subscribe is bound to the connection epoch it was composed for. A send that loses the race
//! against a reconnect is therefore not an error: the replacement connection replays the whole
//! desired set anyway, so the lost message would have been a duplicate. The alternative —
//! letting the transport buffer and replay the send — would produce exactly that duplicate,
//! because the replay and the reconnect handler would both deliver it.
//!
//! The same list is what makes a reconnect survivable at all. The venue keeps no subscription
//! state across connections, so a client that does not re-send loses its feed silently: the
//! socket is up, the strategy simply never receives another bar.
