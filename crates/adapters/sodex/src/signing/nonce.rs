//! Nonce generation for signed requests.
//!
//! SoDEX tracks nonces **per signing address**, not per account, and keeps only the 100
//! highest values seen. A new nonce must exceed the smallest of that set and must never
//! have been used before. Valid values are additionally confined to `(T - 2 days, T + 1 day)`
//! where `T` is the block timestamp in Unix milliseconds.
//!
//! Two consequences shape this module:
//!
//! - Nonces must be monotonic per signing key, so the generator is a counter rather than a
//!   bare clock read: two calls within the same millisecond must still differ.
//! - Because tracking is per *address*, two concurrent processes sharing one API key share
//!   one nonce sequence and will race. The venue's own guidance is one API key per trading
//!   process; [`NonceGenerator`] cannot enforce that across processes, so it guards only
//!   the in-process case.
